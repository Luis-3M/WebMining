# WebMining

Using the information available on the IMDB's website we've accomplished a series of tasks, such as:

1) Find basic information (web page, diretor, cast, etc.) of a movie based on a query string of the title.
   For this specific task our searcher function is getting the following information.

	- Name
	- Description
	- Directors
	- Creators
	- Cast

2) Given the IMDb ID of a movie, obtain the information on all reviews of this movie.

3) Using the reviews information (text of the review plus the score), build a data set for learning a model that can predict the grade based on the text.

4) Using the previous data set try a few prediction models and draw conclusions from this experimental comparison.

5) Summarise the reviews of a movie.
